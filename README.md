# My Portfolio Website

My portfolio website was built using React + Vite and styled with Tailwind. The website showcases my skills and experience as a web developer. It's fast, responsive, and has a modern look. I'm proud of what I've created and believe it's a true reflection of my abilities. This is just the beginning, as I have many more projects in the works and am always looking for new opportunities to collaborate. Reach out if you're interested in working with me.

### What I learned

By gaining a better understanding of the fundamentals of React, I was able to grasp the concepts of React Hooks and Components more effectively. This knowledge allowed me to integrate and utilize different components developed by other programmers, including Toastify, Carousel, Accordion, and React-icons. Additionally, using this app has improved my skills with tailwind, further enhancing my overall proficiency.
